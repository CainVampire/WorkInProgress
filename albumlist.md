# Top 10 Teen Favourite Albums

_in alphabetical order_

Notes: 

* I stopped being a teenager in 1982.

* This is the stuff I listened to _as a teenager_. Much of the new wave stuff that I listened to as it was coming out, and still listen to, had a lesser impact.

* I still have the vinyl of most of these.

* Pretty much a straight-ahead Classic Rock list.

The Beatles, _Revolver_ (expurgated and consequently diminished North American version) (and _Rubber Soul_ and _Sgt Pepper..._ and _Abbey Road_ and ... you get the picture.)

David Bowie, _Changes_

Cars, _Cars_

Cheap Trick, _Cheap Trick at Budokan_ (and _Heaven Tonight_)

The Doobie Brothers, _Livin' on the Fault Line_ (and _Minute By Minute_)

Eagles, _Hotel California_ (interesting observation: the _Greatest Hits_ album was secondary in my listening)

Fleetwood Mac, _Rumours_

Elton John, _Greatest Hits_ (and _Don't Shoot Me..._ and _Goodbye Yellow Brick Road_)

Talking Heads, _Fear of Music_

Weather Report, _Heavy Weather_
