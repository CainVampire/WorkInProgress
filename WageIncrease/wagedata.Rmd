Hey, let's take a look to see what's happened to compensation in the B.C. Public Service over the past decade.

```{r}
setwd("//sfp.idir.bcgov/U152/MHMONKMA$/Profile/Desktop")

wagedata <- read.csv("wagedata.csv", header = TRUE)
ls.str(wagedata)
head(wagedata)
wagedata$Date <- as.Date(wagedata$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
ls.str(wagedata)

wagedata



library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(wagedata, aes(x=Date, y=Index, colour=Group)) +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  scale_x_date() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  ggtitle("Salary increases in the B.C. Public Service\n2006-04-01 to 2016-04-01") +
  ylab("Index (2006-04-01 = 100)") +
  xlab("")



```

Excluded staff need a 6% lift on April 1st to put excluded earning at parity with the gains received by the BCGEU since April 1, 2006.
