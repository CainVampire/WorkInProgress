# Quantitative informaiton as a rhetorical device

You are likely familiar with this glib quotation:

_There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics._
(attributed to Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain)

And you may be inclinded to believe this; or perhaps it is an easy way to dismiss statistics as a rhetorical device. 

There is this quotation, essentially a rebuttal of the first:

_While it is easy to lie with statistics, it is even easier to lie without them._ (attributed to Frederick Mosteller)

I read Mosteller (if that is who said it; attribution is a call to authority, and it seems to be in short supply when it comes to these quoatations about statistics) as meaning that statistics is a verifiable form of evidence; while it's easy to deceive in the face of this evidence, it is easier to ignore evidence and appeal to emotion.

But what of this one?

_Politicians use statistics like drunkards use lampposts: not for illumination, but for support._
(attributed to Hans Kuhn)

Conviction of position, not an exploration of an ambiguous reality.

Let's close with another attribution, one that is closer to my thinking:

_Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read or write._ (attributed to H.G. Wells)
