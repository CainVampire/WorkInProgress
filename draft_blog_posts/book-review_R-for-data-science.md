#### The Sabermetric bookshelf, #5

To say that there are many books about the statistical software environment _R_ is, now, a bit of an understatement. I've got over a dozen sitting on my bookshelf, ranging from the general (Norman Matloff's _The Art of R Programming_) to the package-specific (both editions of Hadley Wickham's _ggplot2_ book). And there are a great many more; the publishers CRC and Springer both have dedicated R series. And let's not forget the self-publishers; shout outs here to Roger Peng, Brian Caffo, and David Robinson.


This variety of resources

Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's  _R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data_ was published in 2017 by O'Reilly. The online edition is available at [http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
